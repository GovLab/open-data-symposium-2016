            <p>As open data becomes entrenched in the policy mainstream, there is an ongoing need to delve deeper into the dynamics of open data practice. At the same time, there is a need to maintain a critical perspective and to develop empirically-tested theories on open data. Researchers across the world have been exploring various issues around the supply, use and impact of open data; the second Open Data Research Symposium offer researchers an opportunity to share completed research and to formulate the open data research agenda.</p>
